About Me
======


I am Xinyu Zhang, an Associate Professor in the School of Statistics in East China Normal University. I obtained my PhD from the Center for Statistical Science at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by Dr. [Dong Li](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/teachers/dongli/) and Dr. [Howell Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5t5s9yMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I have worked  as a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at The University of Iowa under the mentorship of Dr. [Kung-Sik Chan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuqVgEUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My research interests include high-dimensional inference, change point detection, nonlinear time series analysis, frequency domain analysis, and bootstrap methods, as well as matrix and tensor data analysis. I also collaborate closely with scientists in the health sciences and have been working on projects involving brain data, lung radiology data, and more.

My work email address is xyzhang at sfs dot ecnu dot edu dot cn.
