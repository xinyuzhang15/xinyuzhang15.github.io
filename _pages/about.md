About Me
======

<img src="../images/Z30_3671.PNG" class="center"/> 

I am Xinyu Zhang, a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at The University of Iowa. I obtained my PhD from the Center for Statistical Science at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by Dr. [Dong Li](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/teachers/dongli/) and Dr. [Howell Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5t5s9yMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Currently, Iâ€™m working under the mentorship of Dr. [Kung-Sik Chan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuqVgEUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interests include high-dimensional inference, change point detection, nonlinear time series analysis, frequency domain analysis, and bootstrap methods, as well as matrix and tensor data analysis. I also collaborate closely with scientists in the health sciences and have been working on projects involving brain data, lung radiology data, and more.

Beyond academics, I enjoy photography and traveling!
