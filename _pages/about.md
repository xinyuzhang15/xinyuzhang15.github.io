I am Xinyu Zhang, a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at The University of Iowa. I obtained my PhD degree from Center for Statistical Science, Tsinghua University under the guidance of Dr. [Dong Li](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/teachers/dongli/) and Dr. [Howell Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5t5s9yMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Currently, I’m working under the mentorship of Dr. [Kung-Sik Chan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuqVgEUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interest includes high dimensional inference, dependent data analysis, change point detection, nonlinear time series analysis, frequency domain analysis, bootstrap, matrix and tensor data analysis etc. I also collaborate closely with scientists from health fields, and have been working on neuroscience data, lung radiology data, etc.
